# **Authentication System**

A Simple authentication system built in Node.js is a server-side application that uses the popular JavaScript runtime environment to handle authentication tasks. This system is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing users to quickly and securely log in to the system using a username and password. The system uses Node.js to handle the authentication process, including verifying the user's credentials and managing sessions through JWT tokens to ensure that the user remains logged in.

This **AuthenticationSystem** is capable to be used in web applications for Easily Authentication and is known for its reliability and robust security features.
